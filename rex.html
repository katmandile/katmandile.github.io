<h1>Rexhame</h1>
<p>Rexhame is located south of Humarock beach. In order to get to Rexhame you have to either walk through the dunes from Humarock or drive<b> 20</b> minutes on the road because there is no direct route to get to Rexhame beach from Humarock. Rexhame is a very nice part of Marshfield that is filled with little neighborhoods and side streets. My dad has built many <i>big</i> houses in Rexhame and Rexhame is continuing to grow. This is the perfect place for a nice smooth bike ride or <b>a walk with the dogs!</b></p>
